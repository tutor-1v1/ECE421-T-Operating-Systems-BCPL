Write a BCPL program that reads a sequence of strings typed by the user
and creates a linked list containing them all.

But there will be some special command words. These should be obeyed but
not inserted into the list

An input of END will be used to mark the end of the input sequence. The
progrm should stop.

An input of ALL means that the whole list should be printed. It is
perfectly OK for the list to come out backwards.

An input of DELETE means that the next word is to be removed from the
list and its memory (for the link object and for the string) must be
recycled with freevec (even though freevec doesn't do anything yet).

Remember you will need to implement and use strdup().

Remember that strings are packed, four bytes per word, into an array.
You use the "byte N of S" syntax to access the individual bytes. Also
remember that an extra 0 byte is added to mark the end of the string.

Example run:

$ run hw4
Enter the strings and deletions:
> hello
> this
> program
> works
> ALL
works program this hello
> properly
> DELETE program
> dog
> ALL
dog properly works this hello
> cat
> DELETE dog
> ALL
cat properly works this hello
> END
$
