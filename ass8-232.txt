For extra credit only. Quite tricky.

This is an extension to assignment 7.

Add virtual memory to assignment 7. Everything should run with virtual memory
active. The original program should be translated to higher addresses (at or
above 0x80000000 like in class), and the programs that execute in response to
a "run" command should live at low addresses and run in USER mode. You will 
need two different stacks of course (user and system), and your program will
need to handle page faults at least.
