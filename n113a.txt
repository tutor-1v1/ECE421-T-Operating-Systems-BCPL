SSDs gradually leak charge over time (1 to 2 years without power)
Can read or write individual pages, but can only erase whole blocks.
erase sets bits to 1, write sets bits to 0.
Erasing too often makes the blocks wear out.

Pages typically 4K bytes, blocks typically 256K bytes.

part 3:

                                          LSE = Latent Sector Error
                                          URE = Unrecoverable Read Error

     Error type   cheap     costly
                e.g. SATA  e.g. SCSI
     ---------- ---------  ---------
     LSEs          9.4%      1.4%     Latent Sector Error, may be just temporary
     Corruption    0.5%      0.05%

  (data from 1,500,000 discs over three years)



part 4:

Findings about LSEs: (as opposed to UREs, Unrecoverable Read Errors)
  Costly drives with more than 1 LSE are just as likely to develop additional
         errors as cheaper drives.
  For most drives, annual error rate increases in year 2.
  The number of LSEs increases with disc size.
  Most discs with LSEs have less than 50.
  Discs with LSEs are more likely to develop additional LSEs.
  There is a significant amount of spatial and temporal locality.
  Disc scrubbing is useful (most LSEs were found this way)

Findings about corruption:
  Chance of corruption varies greatly across different models within the same
         drive class.
  Age effects are different across models.
  Workload and disc size have little impact on corruption.
  Most discs with corruptions only have a few.
  There is sptial locality and some temporal locality.
  There is a weak correlation with LSEs.
