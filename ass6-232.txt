This has two related parts, both to do with the VAX-11 computer's
operating systems

1. Investigate the structure of the VMS file system
   here are two starting points, but follow things up, don't just stop
   here. Question 4 will require a further search.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files-11
      https://vmssoftware.com/docs/VSI_Gd_to_File_Apps_23Jul19.pdf

   The answer these questions:
   
   1. What is an "extent"?
   
   2. Compare the FILES-11 file structure to multi- or variable-level
      index structures from class. In what ways is it better or worse?

   3. What is the index file, INDEXF.SYS? Is this structure a good or
      bad idea, and why?

   4. What are "ACL"s? Compare them with the normal Unix way of handling
      file protections, -rwxrwxrwx etc. Have we anything to learn from
      them? Could they be used with Unix file systems?

2. Investigate the VAX virtual memory implementation
   here is a starting point for that:
      https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-vax.pdf

   The answer these questions:
   
   5. They only use 512 byte pages. What problems does this cause? Are
      there any benefits to such small pages?

   6. Compare the VAX virtual memory implementation with the ones we
      have studied (Intel's and the emulator's). In what ways is it
      better or worse?
      
   7. Why do you suppose operating systems are not like VMS any more,
      and virtual memory is only very rarely done the VAX way?
