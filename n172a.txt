RAID Levels:

0:  Striping blocks, maybe in chunks.
    B1 B2 B3 B4
    B5 B6 B7 B8

1:  Mirror
    B1 B1
    B2 B2

2:  (not really used)
    Each bit on a different drive,
    synchronise spins,
    parity disc

3:  (not really used)
    like 2, but byte-level spreading

4:  Parity
    Striping + extra disc for XOR blocks
    B1 B2 B3 P123
    B4 B5 B6 P456

5:  Rotating parity
    because P disc is a bottleneck
    B1   B2   B3   P123
    B4   B5   P456 B6
    B7   P789 B8   B9

6:  (not really used)
    Double rotating parity

01: Mirror of stripes
    B1 B2 B1 B2

10: Stripes of mirrors
    B1 B1 B2 B2

50: Stripes and rotating parity
    B1  B2  P12 B3  B4  P34 B4  B6  P56
    B7  P78 B8  B9  P9A BA  BB  PBC BC
