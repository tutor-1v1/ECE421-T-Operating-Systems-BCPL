This is really so that you can be confident that you can 
make the system work before you have to do something more
serious.

The Collatz sequence starting from any integer N>0 is:

  If N is even,
    divide it by two,
  but if it is odd,
    multiply it by three and add one

Keep on doing that until N is reduced to 1.

For example, starting from 196 we get

  196, 98, 49, 148, 74, 37, 112, 56, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34,
  17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Your assignment -

  In BCPL, write a program that repeatedly
    asks the user to enter a value for N,
    prints the collatz sequence starting from N,
    prints the length of that sequence.

Submit your code and a few sample runs.
